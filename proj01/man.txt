DESCRIPTIONS
  Prints the number of lines, words, and characters in each FILE, and the total if more than one file is supplied.

  A word is a sequence of characters separated by whitespace.

  Each <OPTION> must be whitespace separated and begin with a '-'.
  The output is always in the order: <file> <lines> <words> <characters>
  If there are options supplied, then only the options supplied will be seen in the output.
